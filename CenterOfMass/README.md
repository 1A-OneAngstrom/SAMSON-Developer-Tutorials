# Center of mass

This SAMSON Extension demonstrates how to work with signals, events, and slots in SAMSON on an example of an [app](https://documentation.samson-connect.net/developers/latest/apps/) that incrementally computes the center of mass of the system.

Please, refer to the [Incremental computation of the center of mass](https://documentation.samson-connect.net/developers/latest/tutorials/center-of-mass/) tutorial.
