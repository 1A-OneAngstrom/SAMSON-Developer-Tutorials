# Center of mass

This SAMSON Element demonstrates how to work with signals, events, and slots in SAMSON on an example of an app that incrementally computes the center of mass of the system.

Please, refer to the [Incremental computation of the center of mass](https://documentation.samson-connect.net/developers/latest/page_tutorial_center_of_mass.html) tutorial.
