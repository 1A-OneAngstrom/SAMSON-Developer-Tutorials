# State updater: Steepest descent

This SAMSON Extension demonstrates how to create a [state updater](https://documentation.samson-connect.net/developers/latest/modeling-and-simulation/#state-updaters) on an example of the steepest descent minimization algorithm.

Please, refer to the [Programming new state updaters: Steepest descent](https://documentation.samson-connect.net/developers/latest/tutorials/steepest-descent/) tutorial.
