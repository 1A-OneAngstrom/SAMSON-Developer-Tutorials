# State updater: Steepest descent

This SAMSON Element demonstrates how to create a state updater on an example of the steepest descent minimization algorithm.

Please, refer to the [Programming new state updaters: Steepest descent](https://documentation.samson-connect.net/developers/latest/page_tutorial_steepest_descent.html) tutorial.
